# Weather Forecast Report in Power BI

This project involved creating an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize key weather metrics such as temperature, precipitation, and wind speed.

**Data Retrieval Process:**
Source: Live weather data was retrieved using the Weather Data Query Page from Visual Crossing.

**Weather API Query:**
1. Create a free account on the platform.
2. Switch to the API view to generate a query URL for live weather data.
3. Select weather forecast data for July 2024 to January 2025 for India.
4. Ensure the query URL includes your API key by logging in. Adjust the format to CSV in the drop-down menu and copy the URL.
5. This URL enables Power BI to fetch and refresh live weather forecast data automatically.

**Steps to Load Data in Power BI:**
1. Open Power BI and click "Get Data" in the ribbon.
2. Select "Web" as the data source and click "Connect".
3. Paste the Weather API URL into the dialog box and click "OK".
4. Power BI will import data from the API for analysis.
